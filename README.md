2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eugene-lok/journeo-frontend.git
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Mapbox access token.
    ```bash
    REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
